Release Note:
============
This package is still under development and cannot be used.

Persian Calendar
================
Provides Persian Calendar support in Odoo.
This is part of parOdoo. ParOdoo is meant to be a place for Odoo localization for Iran.
People around the world use different calendars. For instance here in Iran we use Persian Calendar (aka [Jalali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar)). Unfortunately Odoo misses the concept calendar in its globalization model. Although users can select their prefered language, it is not possible to spceify a prefered calendar. This project aims at providing such a feaure at least for Persian Calendar.


Usage:
=====
This is still under development.

Technical Notes
===============
People around the world use different calendars. Odoo implementaion of DateTime data relies on Moment. Unfortunatly Moment lacks the concept of `Calendar`,  and its completely clueless to support calendars other than Gregorian, such as the Persian Calendar (also known as Jalali), that's being used in Iran.
To add multi-calendar support, without it being considered in the design of the system, is often a tricky task. 

## Implementation
First of all we need to bring 'Persian Calendar' support to Moment. We will use [moment-jalali](https://github.com/jalaali/moment-jalaali) which is the Jalaali (Jalali, Persian, Khorshidi, Shamsi) calendar system plugin for moment.js. The plugin will be inserted in web assets with a template like this:

```xml
<odoo>
    <data>
        <template id="persian_calendar" inherit_id="web.assets_common">
            <xpath expr="//script[@src='/web/static/lib/moment/moment.js']" position="after">
            	<script type="text/javascript" src="/po_persian_calendar/static/src/js/moment-jalaali.js"></script>
            </xpath>
        </template>
    </data>
</odoo>
```


## 'moment-jalai' Bugs
Unfortunatly we dicovered some bugs and issues in momen-jalali which should be fixed so that it can work in Odoo date-picker.
The first issue is in this 'makeDateFromStringAndArray' function. The 'fields_utils.parse' method will send a set of formats to moment, while trying to format date, as can be noted in the code snippet below one of them is actually a function, namely 'moment.ISO_8601'
```js
function parseDate(value, field, options) {
    if (!value) {
        return false;
    }
    var datePattern = time.getLangDateFormat();
    var datePatternWoZero = datePattern.replace('MM','M').replace('DD','D');
    var date;
    if (options && options.isUTC) {
        date = moment.utc(value);
    } else {
        date = moment.utc(value, [datePattern, datePatternWoZero, moment.ISO_8601]);
    }
    if (date.isValid()) {
        if (date.year() === 0) {
            date.year(moment.utc().year());
        }
        if (date.year() >= 1900) {
            date.toJSON = function () {
                return this.clone().locale('en').format('YYYY-MM-DD');
            };
            return date;
        }
    }
    throw new Error(_.str.sprintf(core._t("'%s' is not a correct date"), value));
}

```

This has not been considered in 

```js
      for (i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
        /// Babak
        /// format can be a function!
        /// format = config._f[i]
        format = typeof config._f[i]=='function'? config._f[i]():config._f[i];
        currentScore = 0
        tempMoment = makeMoment(config._i, format, config._l, config._strict, utc)

```

We also changed code in 'makeDateFromStringAndFormat' for the same issue.

```js
    function makeDateFromStringAndFormat(config) {

        var __f = typeof config._f ==='function'?config._f():config._f;
        var tokens = __f.match(formattingTokens)
            , string = config._i + ''
            , len = tokens.length
            , i
            , token
            , parsedInput
```

Also at the end of 'makeMoment' function, the date is checked against a max value. Because Odoo date-picker uses a maxDate above this value (9999/11/30). This will result of an invalid maxDate which causes an unexpected issue. We just simply removed this:

```js
 if (m._d.getTime() > maxTimestamp) {
        //jm._isValid = false
      }
```

## HttpExtensions
The prefered calendar should be considerd as a user preference , that is the user should be able to select her prefered calendar as one of her prefernces. We will use the recommended method (see (Odoo JavaScript Session)[https://www.odoo.com/documentation/13.0/reference/javascript_reference.html#session]) of transering this sort of settings to the client side using the 'user_context':

```py
class HttpExtensions(Http):
    _inherit = 'ir.http'

    def session_info(self):
        result = super(HttpExtensions, self).session_info()
        if result and result.get("user_context",False):
            user_context = result.get("user_context")
            user = self.env.user
            # Currently we use the selected language.
            # TODO: Add calendar to user preferences and
            # use it here.
            if user and user.lang=='fa_IR':
                user_context['calendar']='jalali'
        return result
```
Then the client side can retreive the selected calendar:

```js
    var session = require('web.session');
    var calendar = session.user_context.calendar;
    /// or using odoo global variable:
    var calendar = odoo.session_info.user_context.calendar
```
